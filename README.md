## CSS challenge: Image animation

- Open `images/images.html`
- Took approximately 4 hours to complete
- Known issue: Hovering from right side causes 'accordion' effect.  Would consider wrapper `<div>` to better control wrapping trigger object, or JavaScript to target and rectify issue


## JS challenge: Widget

- Open `widget/page-with-widget.css`
- Took approximately 5 hours to complete
- CSS compiled with Sass for speed and convenience, source: `sass/stylesheet.scss`
- Known issue: Special characters aren't correctly parsed from the source, resulting in replacement characters. Would have to explore the issue source and consider additional functionality or middleware to `fetch` call.
